<summary>About me</summary>

My names Alex, I'm 19 years old. I'm usually just sitting around doing nothing in-game. I mostly play this game to make skins + listen to the music while offtab, so I may not always be able to read your message - whispering is the best way to get my attention! I don't mind anyone trying to chat with me; I get very, very bored sitting around since I don't often start conversations. If share any interests with me, PLEASE don't be afraid to chat with me! Though I'm not too social myself, I love making new friends. ^_^

<summary>Ponytown</summary>

 I hide freely and permanently. 

 I may be a bit awkward when first talking to someone, I don't chat with people too often!

 I do not accept random friend requests. Don't be upset if I decline if we haven't spoken at least once.

  I don't have many boundaries; you can boop, cuddle, sit with me - I don't really care.

 I tend to be tabbed out in-game; if you really want my attention, whisper me. Please don't take silence as me ignoring you, I'm most likely off-tab or just very tired.

 My statuses are self-explanatory: Online, online ingame - Away, AFK - Busy, busy!

 I may not befriend you if you're a VERY dry chatter, unfortunately - I try my best to be very expressive through my text and I just get a lil bored talking to people constantly saying "k" lolz

 I don't mind people taking inspiration from my skins! Please do not copy directly from my skins - I don't make big deals out of it, but I will perma hide you. I put lots of time and care into my skins and it does kinda bum me out to see someone yoinking it lolz

 Do not use weird sexual humor/teases with me, especially if we just met. Same goes for venting and oversharing.

<summary>Do Not Interact</summary>

 If you're below 14. I am uncomfortable befriending people much younger than me.
 
I hang around the Minecraft area sometimes, so I feel the need to add: If you support GNF or Wilbur Soot "WSS", stay away from me - you're weird.

If you compare Caitlyn Kiramman to people like H/tler, Charlie Kirk. You're very strange.

HH/HB/Vivziepop fans - I've had nothing but bad experiences with these fans, that's it.

I don't have many "DNI's" I just thought I should add specific things that are important enough to me.
