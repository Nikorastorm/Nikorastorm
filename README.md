<summary>About me</summary>

My names Alex, I'm 19 years old and I'm usually just sitting around doing nothing either near the Bakery or in the Minecraft spot above the cave. I don't really do anything other than make skins. If you ever want to talk to me, please, go ahead! I get very bored on the game since I don't really start conversations with anyone most of the time.

 I hide freely and permanently. 

 I may be a bit dry when first talking to someone, I don't mean to sound rude!

 I do not accept random friend requests. Do not be upset if I decline if we haven't spoken at least once.

 I tend to be tabbed out in-game; if you really want my attention, whisper me.

 My statuses are self-explanatory: Online, I'm tabbed in - Away, probably tabbed out - Busy, busy!

 A little something I'd like to add; there's lots of popular fandom things I dislike; Epic fandom as an example "Telemarketing, pancake," 2020-like whatever jokes, sadly I find them "cringe" and very unfunny, so I may not want to befriend you even if we share an interest because of that. This goes for any other over-popular fandom jokes (DDLC: "hanging", Warriors: "Waffles", list goes on).
It's not that serious and I won't block you for it, just don't be surprised if I don't want to befriend you! ^_^

<summary>Do Not Interact</summary>

 If you're below 14. I am uncomfortable befriending people much younger than me.
 
I hang around the Minecraft area sometimes, so I feel the need to add: If you support GNF or Wilbur Soot "WSS", stay away from me - you're weird.

If you compare Caitlyn Kiramman to people like H/tler, Charlie Kirk. You're very strange.

I don't have many "DNI's" I just thought I should add specific things that are important enough to me.
