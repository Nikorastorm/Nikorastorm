<summary>**About me**</summary>

My names Alex, I'm 19 years old and I'm usually just sitting around doing nothing either near the Bakery or in the Minecraft spot above the cave. I don't really do anything other than make skins. If you ever want to talk to me, please, go ahead! I get very bored on the game since I don't really start conversations with anyone most of the time.
