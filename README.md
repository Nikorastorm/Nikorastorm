<summary>About me</summary>

My names Alex, I'm 19 years old. I'm usually just sitting around doing nothing in-game. I mostly play this game to make skins + listen to the music while offtab, so I may not always be able to read your message - whispering is the best way to get my attention! I don't mind anyone trying to chat with me; I get very, very bored sitting around since I don't often start conversations myself, so please, feel free!

 I hide freely and permanently. 

 I may be a bit dry when first talking to someone, I don't mean to sound rude!

 I do not accept random friend requests. Do not be upset if I decline if we haven't spoken at least once.

 I tend to be tabbed out in-game; if you really want my attention, whisper me.

 My statuses are self-explanatory: Online, I'm tabbed in - Away, probably tabbed out - Busy, busy!

 I don't mind people taking inspiration from my skins! I'd prefer if people don't copy them directly, but I truly don't care enough to make a big deal out of it - not that serious to me.

 I don't have many boundaries; I don't care about things like boops, cuddles, all that. 

 Do not use weird sexual humor/teases with me, especially if we just met. Same goes for venting and oversharing.

 A little something I'd like to add; there's lots of popular fandom things I dislike; Epic fandom as an example "Telemarketing, pancake," 2020-like whatever jokes, sadly I find them "cringe" and very unfunny, so I may not want to befriend you even if we share an interest because of that. This goes for any other over-popular fandom jokes (DDLC: "hanging", Warriors: "Waffles", list goes on).
It's not that serious and I won't block you for it, just don't be surprised if I don't want to befriend you! ^_^

<summary>Do Not Interact</summary>

 If you're below 14. I am uncomfortable befriending people much younger than me.
 
I hang around the Minecraft area sometimes, so I feel the need to add: If you support GNF or Wilbur Soot "WSS", stay away from me - you're weird.

If you compare Caitlyn Kiramman to people like H/tler, Charlie Kirk. You're very strange.

HH/HB/Vivziepop fans - I've had nothing but bad experiences with these fans, that's it.

I don't have many "DNI's" I just thought I should add specific things that are important enough to me.
